### Project Overview
This project attempt to analyse dataset from Coca-Cola sales. Coca-cola, a global beverage giant, has amassed an extensive dataset detailing its sales across various regions, channels, and time periods. The objective of this case study is to leverage data analytics to derive actionable insights, enhance decision-making, and optimize sales strategies.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloadedfrom an open source online such as kaggle, FRED or any other data repository site. 

### Dataset
This Dataset consists of 12 Columns which is Unclean and consist of Inconsistent Data. The Data includes information such as retailer, retailer ID, invoice date, state, city, and relevant data that will help us to analyze process.

### Key Elements

Date: Recording the Date of each Sale.

Region: Sales per geographical region

Sum of Profit: To know how much profit Coca-Cola makes every year

Sales per Year: Sales every year made by Coca-Cola

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download](http://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
- Github for Portfolio Building

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA invloved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
what is the overall sales trend
which product are top sellers 
what are the products on peak sales?

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
After Loading the Data into Excel we need to Clean the Data for Analysis. Often we have Dirty data which makes it more difficult to find the key insights or it may give inaccurate information. To avoid problems and confusion we have to ensure that our dataset is clean and in analysis ready state. We need to Clean the data using various functions to avoid any miscalculation;
- Check for any Duplicate Values in the Dataset.
- Check and remove extra spaces.
- Required letter case.
- Check Blank or Null Values in the Dataset

### Data Analysis

  After Cleaning the Data the next step is to Analyze the Data and draw key insights, useful information, conclusions that can support decision-making.

To analyse the dataset, we need to select all the values then insert a Pivot Table on a New Sheet. The pivot table opens in a new sheet once we click ok in the figure below.

After that we can create Pivot Table by ticking the elements required for finding key insights.

 ### Data Visualization
Finally after creating varoius Pivot Tables, we can create our Visualization which helps us to see varoius trends, answer certain questions and make decisions for the company's benefit.
Visualization gives an initial understanding of your data by making trends, patterns, and outliers easily visible, it makes comprehending large volumes of data quickly and efficiently, it helps communicate insights and findings to non-data experts, making your data accessible and actionable, it tends to tell a meaningful and impactful story, highlighting only the most relevant information for a given context. It tells at a glance what is doing well and what is not. 

So lets get started with the first Visual of this dataset. We need to select all the values which are required for our visual. For Calculating Sales by each Beverage Brand we need to add ‚ÄúBeverage Brand‚Äù on Row Axis, then ‚ÄúYears(Invoice Date)‚Äù on Column Axis and ‚ÄúSum of Total Sales‚Äù on Value to provide actual values.

As you can see on the above chart we can see the sales of different Beverage Brands under Coca-Cola have done way better in 2023 then in 2022. The best selling beverage is Coca-Cola with almost 50% more than other Beverages in 2023 and better than 2022. The last is Fanta with 10% more sales then previous year.

Next, We are going to calculate the Sales by Retailer to know which retailer sold the most products and who did the least. 
![Screenshot (119)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fddb40a6-a6b8-4999-9ff7-0b07f97c4e78)

As we can see ‚ÄúFizzyCo‚Äù is the best selling Retailer for the year 2023 with almost 80% more selling rate then 2022. We can see ‚ÄúWest Soda‚Äù did the best in 2022 and also good in 2023 but couldn‚Äôt beat ‚ÄúFizzyCo‚Äù. On the other hand ‚ÄúBevCo‚Äù is not far from ‚ÄúFizzyCo‚Äù in terms of Sales in 2023. The least we can see is ‚ÄúWalmart‚Äù we can only see 3% difference in the sales for the years under review.

Profit Margins

To calculate Profit we need Columns ‚ÄúSum of Total Sales‚Äù and ‚ÄúAverage of Operating Margin‚Äù

                   ![Screenshot (121)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d48641f-b87c-444f-bc7d-fd517eed727e)

As we can see on the left we have ‚ÄúYears‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúQuarters‚Äù divided into 4 quarters each consisting of 3 months period. Next is ‚ÄúSum of Total Sales‚Äù to know how much sales we made in each quarter. ‚ÄúAverage of Operating Margin‚Äù was also calculted to know how much resources we used and whether we were budget.

 ![Screenshot (117)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a35c188f-97cb-4ae5-bd0e-77d028dd5d1c)

Profit Margin by Quarter
we can clearly see that quarter 3 is the most profitable among all other quarters with 90% more profit than 2022. Followed by Quarter 4 which has a significant profit of 85% than 2022.

Dashboard

Dashboard is one of the most important thing to build as a Data Analyst. It consists of all the visuals in a story telling format for stakeholders to have a clear idea about the company‚Äôs performance.

KPI‚Äôs & Metrics

Generated a revenue of 12,016,665 in the last 2 Years.

Massive Record 24,788,610 Units sold within just 2 years.

Calculated the average price costing per unit and its just $0.45.

Conducted a detailed analysis through all the sales, units sold and margins of retailers the total profit generated is 4,722,497.

Recommendations

The marketing strategies applied in Quarter 3 of 2023 should be applied again to improve sales and profits.
Fanta, Powerade and Sprite are the products which needs to be improved as this 3 products have got the least sales among all other beverages.
Also on the other hand, Walmart, Amazon and West Soda have the least amount of sales. This is one of the important aspects to improve among other retailers.
New York, California and Florida are the top performers, more resources should be provided towards marketing campaign.
Limitations

The dataset is still not complete need to get more data to find better findings.
Dataset doesn‚Äôt have Gender and Age which is one of the important things as we need to see which products are consumed by Youth, Adults and Older people and also the Gender whether Males or Females consume more product.
