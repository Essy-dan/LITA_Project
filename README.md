### Project Overview
---
This project attempts to analyze a dataset from Coca-Cola sales. Coca-Cola, a global beverage giant, has amassed an extensive dataset detailing its sales across various regions, channels, and time periods. The objective of this case study is to leverage data analytics to derive actionable insights, enhance decision-making, and optimize sales strategies.

### Data Sources
---
The primary source of data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle, FRED, or any other data repository site. 

### Dataset
---
This Dataset consists of 12 Columns which are Unclean and consist of Inconsistent Data. The Data includes information such as retailer, retailer ID, invoice date, state, city, and relevant data that will help us to analyze the process.

### Key Elements
---

Date: Recording the Date of each Sale.

Region: Sales per geographical region

Sum of Profit: To know how much profit Coca-Cola makes every year

Sales per Year: Sales every year made by Coca-Cola

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download](http://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
- Github for Portfolio Building

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involves exploring data to answer some questions about the data such as;
what is the overall sales trend
which products are top sellers 
what are the products on peak sales?

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
After Loading the Data into Excel we need to Clean the Data for Analysis. Often we have Dirty data which makes it more difficult to find the key insights or it may give inaccurate information. To avoid problems and confusion we have to ensure that our dataset is clean and in analysis ready state. We need to Clean the data using various functions to avoid any miscalculation;
- Check for any Duplicate Values in the Dataset.
- Check and remove extra spaces.
- Required letter case.
- Check Blank or Null Values in the Dataset

### Data Analysis
---

  After Cleaning the Data the next step is to Analyze the Data and draw key insights, useful information, and conclusions that can support decision-making.

To analyze the dataset, we need to select all the values and then insert a Pivot Table on a New Sheet. The pivot table opens in a new sheet once we click ok in the figure below.

After that, we can create a Pivot Table by ticking the elements required for finding key insights.

 ### Data Visualization
 ---
Finally, after creating various Pivot Tables, we can create our Visualization which helps us to see trends, answer certain questions, and make decisions for the company's benefit.
Visualization gives an initial understanding of your data by making trends, patterns, and outliers easily visible, it makes comprehending large volumes of data quick and efficient, it helps communicate insights and findings to non-data experts, making your data accessible and actionable, it tends to tell a meaningful and impactful story, highlighting only the most relevant information for a given context. It tells at a glance what is doing well and what is not. 

So let's get started with the first Visual of this dataset. We need to select all the values that are required for our visual. For Calculating Sales by each Beverage Brand we need to add “Beverage Brand” on the Row Axis, then “Years(Invoice Date)” on the Column Axis, and “Sum of Total Sales” on Value to provide actual values.

As you can see on the above chart we can see the sales of different Beverage Brands under Coca-Cola have done way better in 2023 than in 2022. The best-selling beverage is Coca-Cola with almost 50% more than other Beverages in 2023 and better than in 2022. The last is Fanta with 10% more sales the previous year.

Next, We are going to calculate the Sales by Retailer to know which retailer sold the most products and who did the least. 
![Screenshot (119)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fddb40a6-a6b8-4999-9ff7-0b07f97c4e78)

As we can see “FizzyCo” is the best-selling Retailer for the year 2023 with almost 80% more selling rate than 2022. We can see “West Soda” did the best in 2022 and also good in 2023 but couldn’t beat “FizzyCo”. On the other hand “BevCo” is not far from “FizzyCo” in terms of Sales in 2023. The least we can see is “Walmart” we can only see a 3% difference in the sales for the years under review.

Profit Margins

To calculate Profit we need Columns “Sum of Total Sales” and “Average of Operating Margin”

                   ![Screenshot (121)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d48641f-b87c-444f-bc7d-fd517eed727e)

As we can see on the left we have “Years” followed by “Quarters” divided into 4 quarters each consisting of 3 months period. Next is “Sum of Total Sales” to know how much sales we made in each quarter. “Average of Operating Margin” was also calculated to know the resources we used and whether we were within budget.

 ![Screenshot (117)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a35c188f-97cb-4ae5-bd0e-77d028dd5d1c)

Profit Margin by Quarter
we can see that quarter 3 is the most profitable among all other quarters with 90% more profit than 2022. Followed by Quarter 4 which has a significant profit of 85% than 2022.

Dashboard

A dashboard is one of the most important things to build as a Data Analyst. It consists of all the visuals in a storytelling format for stakeholders to have a clear idea about the company’s performance.

KPI’s & Metrics

Generated revenue of 12,016,665 in the last 2 years.

Massive Record 24,788,610 Units sold within just 2 years.

Calculated the average price cost per unit and it's just $0.45.

Conducted a detailed analysis through all the sales, units sold and margins of retailers the total profit generated is 4,722,497.

Recommendations

The marketing strategies applied in Quarter 3 of 2023 should be applied again to improve sales and profits.
Fanta, Powerade, and Sprite are the products that need to be improved as these 3 products have got the least sales among all other beverages.
Also on the other hand, Walmart, Amazon, and West Soda have the least amount of sales. This is one of the important aspects to improve among other retailers.
New York, California, and Florida are the top performers, more resources should be provided for marketing campaigns.
Limitations

The dataset is still not complete need to get more data to find better findings.
The dataset doesn’t have Gender and Age which is one of the important things as we need to see which products are consumed by Youth, Adults, and Older people and also the Gender whether Males or Females consume more products.
