### Project Overview
This project attempt to analyse dataset from Coca-Cola sales. Coca-cola, a global beverage giant, has amassed an extensive dataset detailing its sales across various regions, channels, and time periods. The objective of this case study is to leverage data analytics to derive actionable insights, enhance decision-making, and optimize sales strategies.





### Data Sources


### Dataset
This Dataset consists of 12 Columns which is Unclean and consist of Inconsistent Data. The Data includes information such as retailer, retailer ID, invoice date, state, city, and relevant data that will help us to analyze process.





### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download](http://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
- SQL - Struvtured Query Language for Querying of Data
- Github for Portfolio Building
- 
- ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  Firstly, need to Import Data from the device to Excel.

It‚Äôs very simple Open Microsoft Excel then go on Data Tab and Click on ‚ÄúGET DATA‚Äù and then there are various sources from where you can import data. Mine was a CSV file so just imported from there and the data is loaded in Excel.

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
  After Loading the Data into Excel we need to Clean the Data for Analysis. Often we have Dirty data which makes us more difficult to find the key insights. To avoid problems and get confused about the data. We need to Clean the data using various functions to avoid any miscalculation.

So we need to check for any Duplicate Values in the Dataset. Go to the Data Tab and Select ‚ÄúRemove Duplicates‚Äù to remove all the repeated values from the Dataset. Refer fig.3a for more reference.



  


  ### Data Analysis

  After Cleaning the Data the next step is to Analyze the Data and find key insights from the given Cleaned Dataset.

For that we need to select all the values from the dataset and then insert a Pivot Table on a New Sheet. 



  ```SQL
  SELECT* FROM TABLE
  WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
  ```
