### Project Overview
This project attempt to analyse dataset from Coca-Cola sales. Coca-cola, a global beverage giant, has amassed an extensive dataset detailing its sales across various regions, channels, and time periods. The objective of this case study is to leverage data analytics to derive actionable insights, enhance decision-making, and optimize sales strategies.

Sum of Profit: To know how much profit Coca-Cola makes every year

Sales per Year: Sales every year made by Coca-Cola

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download](http://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
- Github for Portfolio Building

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA invloved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
what is the overall sales trend
which product are top sellers 
what are the products on peak sales?

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
After Loading the Data into Excel we need to Clean the Data for Analysis. Often we have Dirty data which makes it more difficult to find the key insights. To avoid problems and get confused about the data. We need to Clean the data using various functions to avoid any miscalculation;
    1. Check for any Duplicate Values in the Dataset.
    2. Check and remove extra spaces.
    3. Required letter case.
    4. Check Blank or Null Values in the Dataset

### Data Analysis

  After Cleaning the Data the next step is to Analyze the Data and find key insights from the given Cleaned Dataset.

For that we need to select all the values from the dataset and then insert a Pivot Table on a New Sheet. 



  ```SQL
  SELECT* FROM TABLE
  WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
  ```
