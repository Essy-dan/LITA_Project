### Project Overview
This project attempt to analyse dataset from Coca-Cola sales. Coca-cola, a global beverage giant, has amassed an extensive dataset detailing its sales across various regions, channels, and time periods. The objective of this case study is to leverage data analytics to derive actionable insights, enhance decision-making, and optimize sales strategies.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloadedfrom an open source online such as kaggle, FRED or any other data repository site. 

### Dataset
This Dataset consists of 12 Columns which is Unclean and consist of Inconsistent Data. The Data includes information such as retailer, retailer ID, invoice date, state, city, and relevant data that will help us to analyze process.

### Key Elements

Date: Recording the Date of each Sale.

Region: Sales per geographical region

Sum of Profit: To know how much profit Coca-Cola makes every year

Sales per Year: Sales every year made by Coca-Cola

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download](http://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Data Visualization
- Github for Portfolio Building

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA invloved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
what is the overall sales trend
which product are top sellers 
what are the products on peak sales?

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
After Loading the Data into Excel we need to Clean the Data for Analysis. Often we have Dirty data which makes it more difficult to find the key insights. To avoid problems and get confused about the data. We need to Clean the data using various functions to avoid any miscalculation;
- Check for any Duplicate Values in the Dataset.
- Check and remove extra spaces.
- Required letter case.
- Check Blank or Null Values in the Dataset

### Data Analysis

  After Cleaning the Data the next step is to Analyze the Data and find key insights from the given Cleaned Dataset.

For that we need to select all the values from the dataset and then insert a Pivot Table on a New Sheet. The pivot table opens in a new sheet once we click ok in the figure below.

After that we can create Pivot Table by ticking the elements required for finding key insights.

 ### Data Visualization
 Finally after creating Pivot Table we can create our Visualization and confront our findings for the companies benefit. Visualization always tend to be simple to have a better Understanding and also saying a Story for the performance of the Company in recent Years.

So lets get started with the first Visual of this dataset. We need to select all the values which are required for our visual. For Calculating Sales by each Beverage Brand we need to add ‚ÄúBeverage Brand‚Äù on Row Axis, then ‚ÄúYears(Invoice Date)‚Äù on Column Axis and ‚ÄúSum of Total Sales‚Äù on Value to provide actual values.

As you can see on the above chart we can see the sales of different Beverage Brands under Coca-Cola have done way more well in 2023 then in 2022. The best selling beverage is Coca-Cola itself with almost 50% more than other Beverages in 2023 and better than 2022. The last is Fanta with 10% more sales then previous year. Check fig.5d for detailed and better understanding.

Next, We are going to calculate the Sales by Retailer and check which retailer sold more cokes and which sold the least. This is the insight for the Sales by each Retailer.

As we can see ‚ÄúFizzyCo‚Äù is the best selling Retailer for the year 2023 with almost 80% more selling rate then 2022. We can see ‚ÄúWest Soda‚Äù did the best in 2022 and also good in 2023 but couldn‚Äôt beat ‚ÄúFizzyCo‚Äù. On the other hand ‚ÄúBevCo‚Äù is not far from ‚ÄúFizzyCo‚Äù in terms of Sales in 2023. The least we can see is ‚ÄúWalmart‚Äù we can only see 3% difference in the sales.
